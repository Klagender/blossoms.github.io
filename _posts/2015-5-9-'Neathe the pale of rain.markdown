Wounded,weathered,clutched by pain
touched by those tears of rain  
On wilderness sleeps my memory 
In peace and in tranquility
The songs of love freely wheel
Beneath the damp of veil
Waves glide in harmony
Where streams encounter the sea
<br>
Fondled,cradled,whispered by time
swept away by the embrace of wave
Beckoning the wind-built heaven
Here trees weep blossoms down
I mislay my bride's beauty
and in grave of faith I lay
Under the gaunt violet skies
Where only stars know my eyes
<br>
Mourn for eroded grain
Earth waiting only for sun
And my dawn silently dissolves
'Neathe the pale of rain
<br>
Blossoms of love are strewn
Raindrops of lethe are fallen
On my shore where pearls flower
Where gulls circle in the air
Now the starry night sky lapsed
The tide be the only friend 
Dreams my innocent fantasy
of eternal serenity
<br>
Mourn for eroded grain
Earth waiting only for sun
And my dawn silently dissolves
'Neathe the pale of rain
